Intro
=====

This repo stores some personal latex templates.

In [utils](./utils), there are some simple LaTeX document `cls`es and package
`sty`s, which is useful to know how LaTeX works.

[Resume](./resume/) provides a elegant resume class and a simple html resume (generated by markdown). One can easily make his/her own resume using these tools.
